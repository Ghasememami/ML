## Question 1
we explored how to build and categorize artificial datasets using machine learning tools. We used scikit-learn's make_classification function to create a dataset with 1000 data points, divided into 4 categories based on 3 characteristics. We then experimented with classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier, along with techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune the models for optimal performance.
