## Question 1

we explored how to build and categorize artificial datasets using machine learning tools. We used scikit-learn's make_classification function to create a dataset with 1000 data points, divided into 4 categories based on 3 characteristics. We then experimented with classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier, along with techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune the models for optimal performance.

## Question 2

This Jupyter Notebook guides you through working with the CWRU Bearing dataset, including importing the data, preparing it for analysis, and classifying it. It covers how to transform the data from a time-series format into a table, how to extract meaningful statistics from the data, and how to apply various techniques to get it ready for analysis. The notebook then trains a Logistic Regression model to distinguish between two categories and evaluates its performance using metrics to confirm its effectiveness.

## Question 3

Weather Prediction with Regression Analysis
Looking to predict weather patterns? This Jupyter Notebook delves into analyzing weather data for regression tasks. It guides you through:

-Importing a weather dataset
-Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-Building regression models for specific weather outcomes
-Evaluating model performance using various metrics
