### Task 1: Block Diagram of Training and Evaluation Process
Description
Create a block diagram illustrating the process of training and evaluating a linear classifier model. Explain the various components of the block diagram. Indicate which part of the block diagram changes when transitioning from binary classification to multi-class classification.

### Explanation
1- Data Collection: Collect and preprocess the data.
2- Feature Selection: Select relevant features for training the model.
3- Model Selection: Choose an appropriate linear classifier model.
4- Training: Train the model using the training dataset.
5- Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the testing dataset.
6- Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
7- Feedback Loop: Use evaluation metrics to tune the model and improve performance.
8- Multi-Class Classification
9- In multi-class classification, the model selection and training components need adjustments to handle multiple classes. This often involves using techniques like One-vs-Rest (OvR) or Softmax for multi-class support.

### Task 2: Dataset Generation and Visualization
Description
Generate a dataset with 1000 samples, 4 classes, and 3 features using sklearn.datasets. Visualize the dataset and discuss its complexity. Suggest ways to make the dataset more challenging.

### Task 3: Training and Evaluating Linear Classifiers
Description
Use at least two linear classifiers from sklearn.linear_model with appropriate hyperparameters to distinguish between the four classes in the dataset. Explain the process of selecting hyperparameters and display the training and evaluation accuracy.

Hyperparameter Selection
The hyperparameters for each classifier were chosen based on common practices and adjusted using cross-validation to optimize performance.

### Task 4: Decision Boundary Visualization
Description
Visualize the decision boundaries of the trained model along with the dataset samples. Highlight misclassified samples with different shapes and colors.
