# ðŸ“˜ Mini project 3

# Question 1

This project delves into Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm exploration on the Iris dataset. It investigates the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction, explores linear and polynomial kernels (degrees 1-10), and compares results using metrics and visualizations. The project offers two approaches:

- Scikit-learn Integration: Leverages scikit-learn for SVM classification, dimensionality reduction (method to be specified), and visualization of decision boundaries and principal feature separation in GIF format (degrees 1-10).

- Scratch Implementation: Implements a custom SVM class with kernel_Polynomial, Fit, and Predict methods for polynomial kernels (degrees 1-10). Evaluates accuracy and visualizes principal feature separation in GIF format (degrees 1-10).

This project provides insights into SVM behavior with different kernels and dimensionality reduction, along with code examples (both scikit-learn and scratch implementation).
