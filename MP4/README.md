# ðŸ“™ Mini project 4

This project explores the power of reinforcement learning (RL) for training agents to excel in challenging environments. We delve into two popular RL algorithms, Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double DQN (DDQN), and apply them to the Lunar Lander challenge. Our focus is on:

Comparative Analysis: We meticulously compare the performance of DQN and DDQN with varying batch sizes, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness.

Visualizing Success: To gain a deeper understanding of the agent's learning process, we create a compelling 2D plot video that tracks its behavior across select episodes.

Performance Evaluation: We rigorously evaluate the algorithms using a comprehensive set of performance metrics, including cumulative reward, loss, and success rate, to give you a clear picture of their capabilities.

Getting Started: Detailed instructions on setting up the environment and dependencies are included, making it easy for you to replicate and experiment with this project.

This project offers a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring reinforcement learning and its application to complex tasks like Lunar Lander.
